Comparison of [jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [hyde](http://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde) static website generation engines.

showcasting a minimal set of features:

- archive
  * pagination [?]
  * archive by month and year
- tags/categories
- a normal, "static" page [x]
- reusal of common parts [x]
