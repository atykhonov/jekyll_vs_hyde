Comparison of [jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [hyde](http://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde) static website generation engines.

Will attempt to show a basic implementation of a blog/website,
showcasting a minimal set of features:
- blog posts
  * normal text
  * images
  * quotation
- archive
  * pagination
  * archive by month and year
- tags/categories
- a normal, "static" page
- reusal of common parts
